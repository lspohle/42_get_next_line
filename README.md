# A project from the first ring of the core - get_next_line
Get_next_line is about reading line by line from a file descriptor. It enables us, for instance, to read from a file or from standard input. Moreover, it introduces us to the concept of static variables.

# TEAM - Together Everyone Achieves More

Get_next_line taught me the tremendous potential of our peers. After several hours of coding by myself, I acknowledged that I might not be advanced enough to understand the depth of the given project. It seemed overwhelming and frustrating.

Therefore we decided to address the project as a united front. We brainstormed on how we could approach the project, how we could organize our code, and what might be challenging for us. We empathized with one another and looked at the project from different perspectives. As soon as we isolate ourselves, our point of view is limited. It is communication that broadens our horizon and enriches us.

A great team is not just a composition of experts. From my experience, a great team embodies harmony. We need to listen to one another, and be able to speak up. A great team shall offer even introverts an opportunity to come forward and evolve. It shall even offer extroverts to take a step back and observe. It shall create a sincere environment in which every individual is presented the opportunity to grow. 

Nevertheless, practice makes perfect and, therefore, I would recommend everyone to start more than once from scratch. Even if you do not change your approach, you are reflecting on your current approach again and again. Everytime you take a step back you question yourself. Either you gain confidence in your abilities, or you learn by raising questions.
